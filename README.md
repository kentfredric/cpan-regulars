# CPAN Regulars

Generates lists list the [CPAN once a week](http://onceaweek.cjmweb.net),
but for months, weeks, and days.

See the output at http://neilb.org/cpan-regulars/

# TODO

This was a lashup following an offhand comment from BOOK.
Things to do:

* Add link to CJM's pages
* Find_longest_chains is a copy&amp;paste of find_current_chains -
  should refactor them
* See whether POSIX::strftime() would be quicker than DateTime. I reckon so.
* Highlight people who are safe in the current period
* In all-time lists, highlight chains which are still active
* Where someone has done 52+ weeks, put "(1 year)" after it.
